# functions
These are the work-simplifying scripts that I create and keep improving which keeps improving 


NOTE: Do not use brackets, it skips important stuff if you want to filter out package-extra and package-python, you can do 'package-extra|python' after first argument. Add do you want to see an example function of cat with file.pnq sample file

Tasks to do: 
1. first commit, ====start/end ===
2. replace all conditions with if [ $# == 2 ]
