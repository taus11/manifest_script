# functions
These are the work-simplifying scripts that I create and keep improving which keeps improving 


NOTE: Do not use brackets, it skips important stuff if you want to filter out package-extra and package-python, you can do 'package-extra|python' after first argument. Add do you want to see an example function of cat with file.pnq sample file

Tasks to do: 
1. first commit, ====start/end ===
2. replace all conditions with if [ $# == 2 ]
3. variable for home directory



INSTRUCTIONS TO INSTALL : 
Write your home directory 
example

copy this script to one of your path
write source /usr/local/bin/manifest.sh

restart terminal


If you want to avoid restarting terminal,
just do source manifest.sh
